# [mgnbar.info](https://mgnbar.info)

This is a repository for a website on the moduli space of marked curves,
and its beautiful geometric properties.

What you are seeing is (or rather, will be) an initial version,
conceived as a single-page website only displaying information about the
Kodaira dimension of these moduli spaces. It is intended as a *showcase*
rather than to be a complete tool.

Please use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/pbelmans/mgnbar/issues)
to suggest information you want to see displayed, or get in touch with
one of us through the contact information below.

At some point we will turn the single-page setup into a comprehensive
resource on the geometry of moduli spaces of marked curves, to the extent
that this is of course possible on a webpage.
